                <h2>Welcome to Kayathar</h2>
                <p>
                    Kayathar is a town panchayat located in the Thoothukudi district of Tamil Nadu, India. Situated strategically on the National Highway 44 (NH-44), it serves as a vital link between the southern cities of Tirunelveli and Madurai. While it may appear as a modest town today, Kayathar holds a place of immense significance in the annals of Indian history, forever remembered as the site of a pivotal and poignant event in the fight against British colonial rule.

                <h2>History & Significance: The Land of a Martyr</h2>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>
                        Kayathar's primary claim to fame is its indelible connection to the legendary freedom fighter <strong>Veerapandiya Kattabomman</strong>, a Palayakkarar (chieftain) of Panchalankurichi.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the late 18th century, Kattabomman fiercely resisted the tax-collection demands and growing dominance of the British East India Company. After a series of confrontations and a valiant struggle, he was captured through betrayal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On <strong>October 16, 1799</strong>, in a public display intended to quell any further rebellion, the British hanged Veerapandiya Kattabomman from a tamarind tree in Kayathar. This act of martyrdom transformed him into a folk hero and a powerful symbol of early resistance against colonialism. The site of his execution is now a revered memorial, making Kayathar a place of pilgrimage for patriots and history enthusiasts.
